# Developer Documentation

Welcome to the DataTrovo Developer Documentation! This section is intended for developers and system administrators who need to set up and manage DataTrovo for their organizations. Whether you want to create custom execution environments, integrate scripts via Docker, or handle organizational account settings, this guide has you covered.

DataTrovo offers two general ways of working with scripts:

1. [**Git Connection**](dev-docs/git.md): Link your Git repositories to DataTrovo and manage your queries through version control.  
2. [**Direct Connection**](dev-docs/direct-sql.md): Connect DataTrovo directly to your data sources, and write and manage queries in DataTrovo itself.
