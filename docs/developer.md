# Developer Documentation

Welcome to the DataTrovo Developer Documentation! This section is designed to help developers and system administrators set up and manage DataTrovo for their organization. Whether you're looking to create execution environments, integrate scripts with our platform using Docker, or manage your organization's account settings, this guide has you covered.

There are two general modes of using DataTrovo.

1. [`Git Connection`](dev-docs/git.md): DataTrovo can connect to your Git repositories. Write and manage your queries through Git.
2. [`Direct Connection`](dev-docs/direct-sql.md): DataTrovo can connect to your data sources directly. Write and manage your queries directly in DataTrovo.
