# Documentation for Business Teams

Welcome to the DataTrovo Business Teams documentation. In this section, you will learn how to:

- Search for scripts
- Run queries
- Download data

These features enable you to make informed decisions efficiently and effectively, without needing deep technical expertise.

## Searching for Scripts

Use the built-in search feature in DataTrovo to quickly locate scripts by title, description, or tags. This ensures that you and your team can easily find the analyses or reports you need.

## Running Queries and Scripts

Once you find a script you want to run, simply click the **Run** or **Download** button (depending on the script type). DataTrovo will execute the script in the background and provide results when they are ready.

## Downloading Results

DataTrovo offers multiple options for downloading results, such as CSV or Excel files. These downloads make it easy to share insights with colleagues or use data in external tools for further analysis.
